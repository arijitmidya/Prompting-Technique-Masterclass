        "RaR highlights the disparity between human thought frames and those of LLMs. It improves understanding by allowing models to first rephrase a query before responding, which helps clarify the intent and enhances response accuracy. The two-step RaR approach, which incorporates rephrasing and response LLMs, achieves improved performance across various tasks. The rephrased questions enhance semantic clarity and help resolve ambiguity.\n",
