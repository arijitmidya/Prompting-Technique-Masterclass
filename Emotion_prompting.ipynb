Are you prepared to continue investing in crypto, knowing the inherent volatility? If not, it might be time to diversify into other, less volatile asset classes.\n",
            "* **Develop a long-term strategy:**  If you decide to stay in crypto, focus on a long-term investment strategy.  This might involve Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into projects you believe in, which means investing a fixed amount at regular intervals regardless of the price. This can help mitigate the impact of volatility.\n",
