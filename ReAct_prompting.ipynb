        "ReAct approach integrates the generation of reasoning paths with actionable steps, thereby improving the model’s ability to handle dynamic scenarios. ReAct is particularly useful in decision-making contexts where actions are based on evolving conditions. In question answering, in addition to generating step-by-step reasoning, ReAct prompting addresses issues of hallucination and error propagation by interacting with external data sources, such as a Wikipedia API, to fetch real-time data, which aids in producing more interpretable and verifiable task-solving trajectories.\n",
